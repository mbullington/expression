# Expression

A beautiful (**work in progress!**) iOS calculator for just the basics. Built with Flutter.

**Motivation**: I find the iOS Calculator lacking for basic needs and really enjoy the Google Calculator that ships on Android, 

## Getting Started

You can build it with `flutter run` like most other Flutter apps, however when I feel Expression is ready, I'll release it on [Airport](https://app.airport.community/app/recs0ADItsvb8zRPB) and hopefully the iOS App Store. *You'll most likely want to wait for this.*

## Disclaimer

I hope for a usable quality for Expression, however end-of-the-day it's more a [home-cooked meal](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/) and less of a professional product.
